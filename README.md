# Stake Statistics Enhancer

### Adds options to hide elements in the Stake statistics window. Also calculates estimated RTP for each game in real-time.

This is a userscript for the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extention. 

The script only reads data from the "Live Stats" window on Stake and modifies or adds elements.

### Features
- Show/Hide elements such as:
  - Betting Race
  - Win/Loss Graph
- Calculates RTP for each game (Note: this data resets when page is refreshed like all other Stake stats)
- Calculates win percentage for each game (Note: this data resets when page is refreshed like all other Stake stats)

### This DOES NOT
- Make any API calls
- Read or modify any network traffic to/from Stake
- Read any Stake data except for the information shown on Live Stats pop-up
- Log or store any information
